Tailer is a tool designed to dynamically monitor Kubernetes pod logs, ensuring that logs from all containers, including new and recreated pods, are collected without missing critical events. Tailer overcomes Kubernetesâ€™ default connection timeout limitations and provides a robust solution for long-term log collection.
